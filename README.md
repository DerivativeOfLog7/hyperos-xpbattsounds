# Windows XP battery sounds for HyperOS (Magisk module)
I made three separate versions with different sounds for low battery ([Battery Critical](https://archive.org/details/windowsxpstartup_201910/Windows+XP+Battery+Critical.wav)/[Battery Low](https://archive.org/details/windowsxpstartup_201910/Windows+XP+Battery+Low.wav)/[Hardware Fail](https://archive.org/details/windowsxpstartup_201910/Windows+XP+Hardware+Fail.wav))  
Sounds can be further customized by cloning the repo and placing new files accordingly (I made mine like the default system files, stereo and 44.1kHz; I haven't tried if it'd work with different settings)  
This module may also work on older MIUI versions, but I don't have any devices with MIUI to test it on
